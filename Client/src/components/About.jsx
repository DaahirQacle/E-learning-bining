    <p >When we started Dugsiiye Online Courses back in 2018, our goal was to give Somalis from 
      all across the world the ability to learn the skills they’d need to succeed in this modern 
      century. We set out to create a new, interactive way of learning — making it engaging, 
      flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then, we have helped 
      hundreds of Somali people worldwide unlock modern technical skills and reach their 
      full potential through code. There are two commitments we've made to the world. 
      We've been grounded by these since day one: Increase access to high-quality education for
       everyone, everywhere; Enhance teaching and learning online through research.</p>

        that offers quality-oriented education and accredited certification.

        <h1 className='text-center'>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>We want to create a world where anyone can build something meaningful 
          with technology, and everyone has the learning tools, resources, and 
          opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of possibilities — all that’s 
          required is the curiosity and drive to learn. At Dugsiiye, we are dedicated 
          to empowering all people, regardless of where they are in their coding journeys,
           to continue to 
          learn, grow, and make an impact on the world around them.</p>
